          <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
           <p>
            We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data against accidental loss, unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure. We utilize industry-standard practices to safeguard your data, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>5.1. Encryption:</strong> Your data is encrypted during transmission (using SSL/TLS) and storage to prevent unauthorized access and protect your data from being intercepted while in transit.</li>
           <li><strong>5.2. Access Control:</strong> Access to your personal data is strictly limited to authorized employees, contractors, and third parties who have a legitimate need to know. All third parties are contractually obligated to uphold data security standards.</li>
             <li><strong>5.3. Regular Audits:</strong> We regularly review and audit our security measures to ensure they are effective, up-to-date, and compliant with relevant security standards. We also perform regular vulnerability and penetration tests.</li>
           <li><strong>5.4. Secure Hosting:</strong> We use secure and reliable hosting environments with robust security features. Our systems are behind firewalls to prevent unauthorised access.</li>
              <li><strong>5.5. Data Minimization:</strong> We only collect and retain the minimum amount of data necessary for the purpose of providing our services.</li>
              <li><strong>5.6. Data Retention:</strong> We retain your data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Data transmission over the internet or any wireless network is not entirely secure, and there is always a risk that unauthorized parties might access or intercept your data.
