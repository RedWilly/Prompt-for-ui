          <h2>3. Service Description and Output Usage</h2>
          <p>
           <strong>3.1. Service Functionality:</strong> PixelUI is an AI-powered design-to-code conversion platform that analyzes user-uploaded design mockups and generates prompts, code snippets, and recommendations for web development. The Service also generates AI-powered prompts that can be used in third-party code editors, such as Cursor, Windsurf, or Bolt.new, to facilitate the creation of professional websites and web applications, even without prior coding knowledge. The specific features of the Service are described on our website and may be updated from time to time at PixelUI’s sole discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>3.2. Generated Content:</strong>  PixelUI provides code, prompts, and other outputs ("Generated Content") as a tool to aid users in their development processes.  PixelUI does not claim any ownership rights in the Generated Content. This includes prompts specifically designed for use in third-party AI-powered code editors.
          </p>
             <p>
           <strong>3.3. User's Rights in Generated Content:</strong>  You retain all rights, title, and interest in the Generated Content you create using the Service, including, without limitation, the right to use, modify, distribute, and monetize that Generated Content in any way you choose, subject to applicable laws and any third-party licenses.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>3.4. No Liability for Generated Content and Third-Party Editor Usage:</strong>  PixelUI shall not be liable for any consequences, liabilities, or damages arising out of or related to the use or misuse of the Generated Content by any user, or by third parties who may have access to the generated content through your actions, including but not limited to the performance, accuracy, or results of any code editor, such as Cursor, Windsurf or Bolt.new and the websites/applications you create with it. It is your sole responsibility to review, validate, test, and ensure that all code, prompts, or outputs of PixelUI and any usage of those outputs in any third-party tools is suitable for your intended use. You agree that any use of the generated content and integration with third-party editors is entirely at your own risk.
           </p>
             <p>
            <strong>3.5. "As Is" Service:</strong> The Service and all Generated Content are provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.
